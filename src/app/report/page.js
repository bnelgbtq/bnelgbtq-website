        We want our events to be a safe and inclusive environment. Thatâ€™s why we
        ask our attendees to follow our Code of Conduct!

      <p>
        In the unfortunate case that you see someone violating the code of
        conduct, here are some ways you can report it to us:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Let an <a href="/who/">organiser</a> know, either in person or via
          socials
        </li>
      </ul>
